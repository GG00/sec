SEC (Simple Event Correlator) 2.6.1

Introduction:
-------------
SEC is a tool for accomplishing event correlation tasks in the domains of 
log analysis, system monitoring, network and security management, etc.
Event correlation is a procedure where a stream of events is processed, 
in order to detect (and act on) certain event groups that occur within 
predefined time windows. Unlike most other event correlation products which
are heavyweight solutions, SEC is a lightweight and platform-independent
event correlator which runs as a single process.

Release Notes:
--------------
SEC has been tested primarily on Linux and Solaris, but since it is written 
in Perl and does not use any platform dependent subroutines, it should also
work on other OS platforms.
Because SEC is generally not tested against outdated Perl releases, it is 
recommended to run SEC with at least Perl 5.6 (see http://www.perl.org for 
the latest stable release). 
SEC uses Perl Getopt, POSIX, Fcntl, IO::Handle, and Sys::Syslog modules
which are included in the standard Perl installation.
